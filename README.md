Stephanie Nelli and Compton French

Continuing on the ideas presented in Sheahan et al. 2021 and Nelli et al. 2023. Building a Recurrent Neural Network that will conduct Knowledge Assembly in various training curriculum such as blocked, baseline, and interleaved. The full context range is 1-8 objects, divided into two seperate contexts, 1-4 and 5-8.
